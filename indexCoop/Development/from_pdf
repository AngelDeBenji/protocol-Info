**Core Contributors:**
The Index Coop breaks down its core contributors into owl levels: Golden, Silver, and Bronze. Golden Owls are the core contributors to the Index Coop. Silver Owls add meaningful Index Coop contribution extending beyond governance call attendance and forum participation. Bronze Owls consist of governance call attendees and active Discord and Forum participants. Every month the Index Treasury Committee distributes rewards to active community members based on their contributions to the Index Coop. Contributors are categorized into three categories: Gold, Silver, and Bronze owls.


**Engineering Team:** The Engineering Team is currently focusing on Flexible Leverage Index with Compound, Exchange Issuance Contract, Deploying Coinshares Index and the patrons for these projects include: @defipulse, @lemonadeAlpha, and @mgcpetch. Implementers for this project are: @setprotocol and @ncitron


Gold and Silver owls from the most recent reward distribution may allocate some quantity of INDEX-- defined at the beginning of each month-- for “bounties”.


**Bounties:** are any work that furthers the goals of the Index Coop. Gold & Silver owls are not obligated to create any bounties and may choose to never allocate any bounties.

The January bounty allocation for Gold & Silver Owls is 40 $INDEX.
